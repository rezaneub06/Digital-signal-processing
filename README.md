3. Test case 1:

1       test case
2       signal part
-5      lower bound
5       upper bound
2       two component
1       no amplitude
2        unit step signal
1        shifting has
3        shifting amount
2        no mirroring
2        no downsampling
1       Add which is add first component
1       no amplitude
2       unit step signal
1       has shifting
-2     shifting amount
2       no mirroring
2       no downsampling
2       2nd component will be subtract from 1st component
-3      lower bound
7        upper bound
1        2nd part component
1        no amplitude
2        unit step signal
2        no shifting 
2        no mirroring
